# BitBackup 
BitBackup, is a robust and user-friendly open-source backup tool, designed to help users efficiently and securely backup their important files and folders, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

# Core Functionality
At its heart, BitBackup ensures that the contents of a specified Source Directory are mirrored to a designated Backup Directory. It performs a two-way backup:

- **Copy/Update:** It identifies new files in the Source Directory and copies them to the Backup Directory. For existing files, it checks if the source file has been modified (based on modification time and content comparison) and updates the backup version if necessary.

- **Remove Outdated:** It removes files and empty directories from the Backup Directory that no longer exist in the Source Directory, ensuring your backup accurately reflects the current state of your source.

# Profile Management
At the top of the application window, you'll find the Profile Name section, which is central to organizing your backup tasks.

# How It Works (Technical Overview)
BitBackup leverages several Python modules to achieve its functionality:

`filecmp`: Used for efficient comparison of files to determine if they need to be updated in the backup.

`threading`: Enables background execution of synchronization tasks, preventing the UI from freezing.

`tkinter` and `customtkinter`: Provide the graphical user interface framework, allowing for a modern and customizable desktop application.

`json`: Used for serializing and deserializing application data (profiles, logs, preferences) to and from disk.

`datetime` and `time`: For timestamping logs and managing auto-backup intervals.

BitBackup is a comprehensive solution for local file backup, offering a blend of automation, control, and user-friendly design.

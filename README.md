#BitBackup 
is an open-source backup application designed to help users synchronize their important files and folders. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage multiple backup profiles, allowing you to specify source and backup directories for each. The application supports both manual and automatic synchronization, with configurable intervals for automated backups.


The BitBackup application features a clean and intuitive user interface, designed to make file backup and management straightforward. The main window is organized to provide easy access to profile management, backup operations, and application settings.

Here's a breakdown of the key interactive elements you'll find:

Profile Management
At the top of the application window, you'll find the Profile Name section, which is central to organizing your backup tasks.

Profile Selection Dropdown: This dropdown allows you to switch between your saved backup profiles.

Create Profile Button (‚ûï): Clicking this button initiates the process of creating a new backup profile. You'll be prompted to enter a name for the new profile and then select its source and backup directories.

Rename Profile Button (‚úèÔ∏è): This button allows you to rename the currently selected backup profile. It will activate an inline editing field where you can type in the new name.

Delete Profile Button (üóëÔ∏è): Use this button to remove the currently selected backup profile. A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental deletion, as this action also removes the profile's associated data file and backup history.

Backup Operations
The core functionality of BitBackup is driven by a set of prominent action buttons.

BACKUP Button: This is the primary button to initiate a manual backup for the currently selected profile. When clicked, the application will begin copying and updating files from your source directory to your backup directory.

PAUSE/RESUME Button: During an active backup, this button toggles between pausing and resuming the ongoing process, giving you control over when the backup runs.

STOP Button: If you need to halt a backup immediately, the Stop button will terminate the current operation.

Automatic Backup
BitBackup offers convenience through its automatic backup feature.

Auto Backup Dropdown: Located near the profile selection, this dropdown allows you to configure scheduled backups for the active profile. You can choose from intervals like "Off," "1 Day," "1 Week," "1 Month," or "1 Year," enabling the application to automatically perform backups in the background.

Preferences
To customize your experience, BitBackup includes a dedicated preferences section.

Preferences Button (‚öôÔ∏è): Clicking this gear icon opens a separate dialog window where you can adjust various application settings, including:

Theme: Switch between "System," "Light," or "Dark" appearance modes.

Accent Color: Choose a primary accent color for the application's UI elements.

Font: Select your preferred font from a list of available options.

These interface elements work together to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for managing and performing your file backups with BitBackup.
